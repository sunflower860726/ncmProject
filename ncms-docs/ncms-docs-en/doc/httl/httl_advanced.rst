Advanced HTTL
=============

Using HTTL in CSS
-----------------

Sometimes it's required to include a request dependent conditional logic into CSS.
This can be achieved as shown below:

HTTL template:

.. code-block:: html

    <html>
    <head>
        ...
        <link href="css/site.httl.css?style=black" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>
    </head>
    ...
    </html>

In this example CSS resource is called with a query parameter `?style = black`, which is handled while
processing `site.httl.css` template file.


`css/site.httl.css` file:

.. code-block:: css

    .main {
        #if(ifRequestParameter('style', 'black'))
          color: black;
        #else
          color: blue;
        #end
    }

There is a conditional HTTL directive `#if` and Î·CMS method to check a value
of a given request parameter: `ifRequestParameter`. To allow the `css` file
to be processed as a template, just specify its extension as `.httl.css`.


.. warning::

     Usage of dynamic HTTL logic inside `css` is not recommended for a couple of reasons.
     First, it is impossible to use compressed CSS files, and second, CSS markup
     becomes mixed with HTTL and therefore it will be more complex.
     A simpler and perhaps more appropriate solution would be to utilize
     different `CSS` files for different page styles
     and to include them to a page conditionally.
